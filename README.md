##### Tableau Analysis: https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikeAnalysis_16000362918540/CitiBikeAnalysis?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link

## Overview:
#### In this project, I assumed the role of an analyst for the Citi Bike program of New York city. My task was to glean insights into the 2019 transit patterns of each bike and user analysis utilizing Tableau. The data was extracted from the Citi Bike open data source (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). 

## Bike Transit Patterns:
### Through my analysis, most of the final destination spot of most citi bike trips in 2019 were in Manhattan. Specifically, the most travelled to destination was Pershing Square north. This is due to the Grand Central station that is no more than a block away.

## User Analysis:
### The vast majority of customer are subscribed users. The percentage split of subscribers to nonsubscribers is around %15 non-subscribers. The gender breakdown of users is predominantly male with about %33 of the user base to be women. This could be due to the risky nature of the mode of transportation. The weekly data chart shows that more bikes are used when the weather is warmer.
