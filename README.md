## Overview:
#### In this project, I assumed the role of an analyst for the Citi Bike program of New York city. My task was to glean insights into the 2019 transit patterns of each bike and user analysis utilizing Tableau. The data was extracted from the Citi Bike open data source (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). 

## Bike Transit Patterns:
### Through my analysis, discoveries were made showing that most bikes were used to travel to destinations in Manhattan considerably more than any other burrow of New York in 2019. This is due to the several iconic destinations of Manhattan which these stations are located near.  This can be exemplified by the top three most travelled to station. First the most travelled to station was Pershing Square north which is located just a block from the iconic Grand Central station. There could be a correlation between train and bike users. The next most travelled to station is located at E 17th and Broadway which is near the historic Union Square. Lastly, the third most travelled to station is Broadway and E 22nd St which is near Madison Square Park. These three iconic destinations draw Citi Bike users. Utilizing this information Citi Bike could gain more revenue through in app advertising for businesses in areas with heavy station traffic.

## User Analysis:
### Upon inspection of Citi Bike users three significant insights appeared. These were the demographic breakdown of users, the relation between time of year and user volumes, and age of users. First, eighty five percent of users are subscribed to the Citi Bike service. This means that retention rate of repeat users is extremely high which could bolster advertising reliability. The Citi Bike user is also predominantly male with only thirty three percent being female. This could be due to several factors, some of which could be the risky nature of said mode of transportation in high traffic areas or group migration for safety in high crime areas.  Secondly, it appears that user volume is dependent on time of year. This is due to weather patterns with more user volume in the summer months. It is more comfortable to ride in a heated car in the middle of winter in New York than riding a bike in snowy sidewalks in twenty-degree weather. Lastly, through an analysis on users age it appears that most users were born in 1969. This seems unlikely and the app should be analyzed to better gather accurate age data.
